Asher's Weather App

This is a weather app I created using the python interface Tkinter. 

The user has a box they can search for a specific city/town. Data is taken from Openweather using 
their api, and specific data about temp (current, high, low), wind, and current weather are 
displayed on the app.

I used a youtube tutorial on how to create the app initially and how to use Openweathers api, then
I researched python GUI's and then learned how to use tkinter then made the display for the app.
